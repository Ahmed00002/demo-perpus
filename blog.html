            <h2>Travel to <strong>Cox-Bazar</strong></h2>
            <p><p>Last <em>June</em> I went to <strong>cox-bazar</strong> with my family. It was an amazing travel. We enjoyed it very much. Because it was a <strong>family tour</strong>. We are used to make travel with family. We discovered the beach with full of fun. We played football on the beach also we took lot of pictures for memories. There was a <strong>Touring</strong> guy with us. He guided us very well. After all the travel was so enjoying</p></p>
